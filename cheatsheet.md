Welcome to our Candyland game! 

Basic gameplay:
You will start out with two command options, 'draw' and 'quit'. 'Draw' enables you to move along the board and keep playing the game, while 'quit' will end the game. When you pass certain tiles, additional commands will also be enabled. 

Boss battles:
When you enter the territory of a boss, you will have the option to fight or continue by choosing 'yes' or 'no'.
If you beat a boss, you will have the option to gain life with 'life' or advance a certain number of tiles with 'move' (the number you will gain/move depends on the boss you beat.)
If you lose to a boss, you will have the option to lose life with 'life' or go back squares with 'move'. Similarly to what happens if you win, the number of life/squares depends on the boss. 
If you choose not to fight a boss, nothing happens and you continue on your way.

Licorice squares and rainbow bridges:
If you land on a multiple of 7, you got stuck on a licorice square! You have to choose to lose life or move back, with either 'life' or 'move'.
If you land on square 13 or 33, you landed on a rainbow bridge! You advance 10 squares.
